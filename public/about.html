<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My childhood dream was to be a teacher.</p>

<p>There were obvious things that drew me to the profession; leadership positions, influencing the trajectory of people's lives, the fun nature of the youth, and the smell of coffee from the teacher's break room. â˜•</p>

<p>Although I may not want to be a teacher anymore, I find myself gravitating towards roles that still have all those things (especially the coffee) and as I dive deeper into the world of UX, I'm starting to see the parallels.</p>

<p>In UX, I bring my love for understanding people, advocating and contributing within team projects, and agile thinking to my work. I always make sure that I connect closely with my clients too, to make sure I accurately present their brand voice in their products.ðŸ“”</p>
